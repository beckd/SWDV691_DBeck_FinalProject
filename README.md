## 8/11/19 -- Getting Into the Groove
The game is now semi-functional beginning to end. You can go through the game, win or lose, and see your stats change each page (in console, there is a known bug displaying them on screen I have logged on my trello board). I can know turn my attention to the three villain/boss encounters I have planned and the final page. This will probably be the bulk of my work for the coming week.

## Server Code Repo:
beckd/SWDV691_DBeck_Final_Project_Server
* To run the server point your CLI toward the folder where it's locally stored and run the following command:
```
node server.js
```
* Note that I plan on hosting this code in Heroku and will update this ReadMe when that's set up.

 ## Getting the app running
* At this phase of development you must run the app locally using Ionic. To install Ionic use the following CLI command:
```
npm install -g ionic
```
This will install Ionic globally. 
* Download the repository locally, and navigate to the the SWDV691_DBeck_Final_Project folder in your command line interface. Once there use the following command:
```
ionic serve
```
This will run the app via localhost, it should automatically appear in your browser

 ## A Text-Based Adventure
This project will build on a previous project from all the way back in SWDV 600. In that class we built a TBA using only Python. I want to go back and revisit this project, adding to it all the things I've learned since then. I want to translate this single file game into a fully fledged game that is hosted and accessible to the public.

 ## My Trello board for this project:

 ## Using Ionic
I plan on using Ionic with Cordova for this project. I believe the Tabs template (that I've used before) would provide a natural framework to rapidly develop my MVP. 

 ## Other Technologies I plan on using are:
* MongoDB - for Database storage
* Heroku - for hosting
* Mongoose - for web services
